# Building a Semantic Search Engine with Python

Welcome to the repository for the tutorial video on building a semantic search engine using Python for natural language processing (NLP).

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we dive into the world of NLP to create a semantic search engine that can retrieve relevant information based on user queries. By following the steps outlined in the video, you'll learn how to set up your environment, write Python code using VS Code, and implement each component of the search engine.

## Getting Started
To get started with building your own semantic search engine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. **Set Up Environment**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies using `conda` or `venv`.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running:

4. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python script `app.py` to run the semantic search engine. Follow the instructions provided in the video for any additional setup or configuration.
